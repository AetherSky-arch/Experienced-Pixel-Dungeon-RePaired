# Experienced Pixel Dungeon: RePaired

Experienced Pixel Dungeon (Redone) was an open-source pretty grindy traditional roguelike dungeon sandbox with randomized levels, enemies and opportunities to abuse the game, and hundreds of items to collect and grind for. It was based on the [source code of Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon), by [00-Evan](https://shatteredpixel.com).

On September the 28th, 2024, it's developer, TrashboxBobylev, ceased its development with this final message:

```
This is the last official version of Experienced Pixel Dungeon, Redone or otherwise. No more bugfixes, ports to latest Shattered, or new content. That's the end of the line.\n\n\
 

2024 is anniversary to many things, including this mod, as 4 years have passed since the first release of that silly grinding mod with many things to do; but since then, the tumor has only grown larger...
 

You might have noticed, that large amount of content haven't really changed since its first year of 2020-2021. After that, I just fixed bugs and ported Shattered's new releases, with big things only happening once a year. It almost became an another job, that I did to keep its legacy going further and further, sometimes even at expense of project I actually enjoyed, like Summoning.
 

And then it really took off in 2023. My email started being flooded with reviews and emails about how it is the best game they played, or reported game breaking glitches. The legacy design didn't stand up very well, and breaking integer barriers is bond to make things wrong. But I kept going. For honor, for people, to keep the tumor alive...
 

I hated it, but I told myself, than I should do it. It's the most popular mod of mine, why I would cancel it? What would happen to those PD fans, that enjoyed grinding? But just like cancer, playing or making ExpPD results in never ending pain.
 

So I am ending it. For my own sake. You may not be happy. But I am happy. Than the beast is slain.
```

Indeed I was not happy! But I obviously wasn't gonna force a developer I admired to work on something they disliked, and so I started to dive into ExPD's source code to fix the bugs I had noticed during my own playthroughs. 
This is what this project is! I don't know enough about Shattered PD to port this to its new versions or to add new content (yet), but I can at least work on keeping this game playable. Naturally, you can help me take on this task by opening issues (please send your error logs) or making pull requests!

If you like this game and want to support me, you can't! [Support Evan Debenham](https://www.patreon.com/ShatteredPixel), who made Shattered, instead.

The game also has *no* translation project hosted on Transifex.
